Spatial Analyst Supplemental Tools
Last Updated: 11/20/2013

Version: 1.3

What's new
1. Added a new parameter 'Along longest upstream' to the Maximum Upstream Elevation tool.
2. Added Tabulate Area 2 which has the same functionality as Tabulate Area but also accommodates overlapping polygons as zone input.
3. Removed Zonal Statistics as Table for Overlapping Features and replaced it with Zonal Statistics as Table 2.  The new tool works with overlapping features for zone input as well as non overlapping zone input and raster zone input.

	
This version requires: 
	ArcGIS 10.1 Service Pack 1 or later.
	Spatial Analyst extension license.

Note:
Parameter data types have been updated to support localized versions of ArcGIS.
If you do not have the minimum requirements you can modify the toolbox to 
work properly in 10.1. Please read, 'How to use toolbox on ArcGIS 10.1'.
